Why we use hello world as first program that execute in every programming Language?


The tradition of using "Hello, World!" as the first program in a new programming language or 
environment traces its origins back several decades. 
Certainly! The use of "Hello, World!" as a starting program has deep roots in computer programming culture.

The "Hello, World!" program was popularized by the book "The C Programming Language" which was published in 1978. 
This book introduced the C programming language. 

In this book the "Hello, World!" example was used as a simple demonstration of how to write, compile, 
and execute a program in C. -->  Historical Context

"Hello, World!" is a straightforward program, regardless of the programming language. --> Simplicity

When someone writes their first program, there's a sense of accomplishment in seeing immediate output.
When learning a new programming environment or setting up a development system, it's essential to know 
that the setup works as expected. 
"Hello, World!" provides an easy way to confirm that the system can compile and run code successfully. 
--> Validation

Over the years, "Hello, World!" has gained universal recognition in the programming community. 
It serves as a shared experience that every programmer, regardless of their expertise or background 
--> Universal Recognisation

The phrase "Hello, World!" is straightforward and easily understood across different cultures and languages. 
The greeting represents a friendly introduction for programmers introducing themselves to a new language or platform.
--> Human Connection

So, next time you type in "Hello, World!", remember you're not just writing a line of code; 
you're joining a tradition that dates back decades, connecting with programmers worldwide, past and present!

"""
Ever started your Python journey with print("Hello World!")?

It's simple, but there's a lot happening in that one line. Let's break it down!

1. print: The Function:

At its core, print is a built-in function in Python. A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a 
specific task.
Whenever you call print, you're telling Python: "Hey, I want you to display something for me!"

2. Parentheses ():

In Python, we use parentheses to call a function. When you see (), it's like pressing the "play" 
button on a remote. You're telling the function to do its job.

Anything inside these parentheses are the details or instructions for the function. 
Think of it as giving the remote specific commands, like "increase volume" or "change channel".

3. "Hello World!" - The String:

The text between the double quotes is what we call a "string" in programming. Strings are sequences of characters.
In our case, the string is "Hello World!", but it could be any text, like "I love Me" or "Hi FreshersCode!".

4. " " --> We tell computer as The content between these are not a code it's not a function or variable to do 
something. There is no need to change that thing.

What Happens When We Run It:

When you run print("Hello World!"), you're asking Python to take the string "Hello World!" and 
display it to the screen. It's like telling your TV to display a specific channel.
Narrator: So there you have it! With print("Hello World!"), you're using one of Python's built-in functions
to communicate with the user. It's your first step in the dialogue between human and machine, 
a tradition that's been around for decades!
